The following phenomena have been illustrated in our test suite:

1. Matrix yes/no questions

Yes/no questions in Marathi are marked with the question particle "kaa" at the end of the sentence. The particle turns declarative sentences into interrogatives. The declarative sentence is not changed in any way beyond the addition of the question particle. The first example shows the grammatical question "did he come back yesterday?"and the second example shows the declarative sentence "he came back yesterday". The only difference between the two is the question particle. The third example shows that the question particle can only occur at the end of the sentence in positive yes/no questions. This changes with wh-questions, which is shown in the final example.

This phenomena was represented in the customization suite by creating a seperate question particle "kaa" in the Matrix Yes/No Question section. The particle is selected to occur only in sentence-final position. 

Negative yes/no questions were also addressed in the test suite, and follow similar rules to other yes/no questions. The particle "kaa" still occurs in sentence-final position, but with the negative auxiliary "naahii" immediately before it. The first example shows a grammatical negative question with "kaa" occuring after "naahii", and the second example shows an ungrammatical example with "kaa" occuring before "naahii."

This was handled in the customization suite the same way as the other yes/no questions. "kaa" still always occurs in sentence final position. Negative questions parsed. 

There was another phenomenon we documented involving leading negative questions, such as "he did not come, did he?"

Antariksh, a native speaker of Marathi, pointed out that this would be seen as two seperate sentences. The sentence did not parse, because our grammar does not allow for verbs to be reduplicated. The lab did not list this as something to be tested for, but we found it interesting and thought it worth mentioning. 

2. Coordination

There are a variety of coordination strategies in Marathi. We documented coordination of sentences and elements within them with the Marathi equivalents of "but", "and", and "or". 

"And" coordination of sentences can occur via asyndeton or monosyndeton strategies. Any number of sentences can be coordinated by either one. The monosyndeton strategy places the word "aanni" before each coordinated element except the final. The following examples illustrate the asyndeton strategy, and grammatical examples of the placement of "aanni" in the polysyndeton strategy.

Meeta went home and I went to the market

This was handled in the customization suite by allowing for asyndeton coordination of sentences only, and allowing "aanni" to coordinate nouns, NPs, VPs, and sentences. 

"aanni" can coordinate any number of other elements as well, and this was documented in the test suite. Below are grammatical and ungrammatical examples of "aanni" coordinating nouns and VPs. The rules for "aanni" remain the same. It can appear before each coordinand, but only obligatorily occurs before the final element. The ungrammatical examples illustrate incorrect placement of "aanni" or have excluded it entirely, illustrating that juxtaposition can only be used when coordinating sentences.

These examples were handled in the customization suite by allowing "aanni" to coordinate NPs, VPs, Nouns and sentences. It was selected as a polysyndeton rule, and a second rule was created with the same word allowing for a monosyndeton strategy. 

The Marathi equivalent for "or", "kimwaa", can also coordinate nouns, NPs, VPs, and sentences. "Kimwaa" carries the same rules as "aanni." It can occur before each coordinand, but only obligatorily occurs before the final element. The following examples illustrate grammatical and ungrammatical examples of "kimwaa" coordination. The ungrammatical examples show incorrect placement of "kimwaa", or leave it out entirely showing its necessity.

This was handled in the customization suite by allowing "kimwaa" to coordinate nouns, NPs, VPs, and sentences, and indicating that it occurs before the coordinand. Two strategies were created for the word, one polysyndeton and one monosyndeton. 

The final type of coordination we explored was "but" coordination, with the word "pann". "Paan" is monosyndeton, and is only placed before the final coordinated element. "Pann" can coordinate sentences, VPs, NPs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs. The following examples illustrate grammatical and ungrammatical examples using "pann."

This was handled in the customization suite by creating a monosyndeton coordination strategy for "pann" that allows it to coordinate nouns, NPs, VPs, and sentences and specifying that it occurs before the coordinand. 

3. Attributive Adjectives

Attributive adjectives in Marathi occur before the noun they modify. Not all nouns are gendered, but those that are must agree with the noun they modify. The following examples illustrate grammatical and ungrammatical examples of adjectives. The ungrammatical examples show ungrammatical word ordering and agreement.

The customization matrix is not able to handle adjectives, so these are not represented in our grammar yet and cannot be parsed. 

4. Adverbs

Manner adverbs in Marathi occur immediately before the verb they modify. Their form does not change depending on the verb they modify. The following grammatical and ungrammatical examples illustrate correct word ordering with adverbs.

The customization matrix cannot handle adverbs. Our grammar cannot yet parse them. 

5. Embedded Clauses

Embedded clauses are marked by the complementizer "kii" preceding the embedded clause. "kii" is used in both declarative and interrogative clauses.

(The) police asks me if I sleep

The customization suite is not equipped to handle embedded clauses, and our grammar does not parse them yet. 

6. Non-verbal predicates

Sentences with non-verbal predicates use the verb "as" (to be) as their copular verb. It agrees with the subject and occurs in sentence-final position. The non-verbal predicate can be a noun, adjective, or adverb. The copular verb must agree with the predicate in gender and pernum.

Sentences with NP predicates currently parse, but it's a hack. Non-verbal predicates are not represented in the customization, but the auxiliary verb "aahe" is present as an auxiliary. 

7. Information Structure

Focus in Marathi can be indicated in two primary ways. Stress, which can't be indicated in text, and movement, which is what our test suite focues on. The element in focus is moved to the sentence-initial position. The first example is a grammatical sentence where movement has been taken place. The second example shows the original sentence, in which the focus could be indicated by stress if it were spoken.

The only way we could think of to handle this in the customization suite was to allow transitive verbs to take a number of different cases for both their subjects and objects, but this would lead to huge overgeneration. The customization suite has an option that always puts the focused element as sentence initial, but, while that is true for our text examples, it is not true of the language as a whole. 

In Marathi, the topic is generally the subject of the sentence. There is no particular marker that specifically marks the topic. Sentences can be topicalized, as shown below.

As for his going to Nagpur, it was necessary

This is another situation where the solution appeared to be allowing certain verbs to take a wider amount of cases, but that again leads to overgeneration. 

Topic can be marked the contrastive particle "tar" as well. "tar" follows the phrase or item being marked as the topic, as in the following examples.

A topic marker that occurs after nouns was created in the information structure section of the customization suite to handle this.

Test Suite Coverage

Our grammar had 42.4% coverage, down from 58.2% coverage on Monday, which was after we got it to load and before we added any thing new to the test suite. 42 items parsed, and they were all items that should parse. However, several of them had far too many derivations. Item #116, a coordination example, had 80 different derivations.

These are all things that should parse later on when adjectives and prepositions are added to the grammar. 

The more concerning non-parsing sentences were due to nouns and verbs that do have lexical entries not inflecting correctly.

Meeta went home and I went to the market

badzaar-aat is not parsing, but is in the lexicon and should be inflecting as per the locative_lexical_rule.

I think there is something in the lexical rules that is causing this not to parse. I've gone over them a few times, and I can't seem to see what it is. Last week I fixed a bug simply by deleting and recreating the entire noun hierarchy, so maybe that needs to be done again to the lexical rules. 



Changes to the Grammar

The biggest changes to the grammar were the additions described above in the test suite section. Additions were made for information structure, coordination, and yes/no questions.

The following lexical items were added to the grammar:

ghaar- home
ge- go
miitaa- proper noun
ravi- proper noun
aa- come
kaam- work
mulgii- girl
mulgaa- boy

A position class was added for irregular verbs. The lexical rule within that class deals with the verb "dila" (gave). The stem is listed simply a "d", because the "i" is phonologically inflected and that vowel changes depending on the tense of the verb. 

The noun hierarchy was redone and simplified. There are no longer supertypes for gender, that information is now placed lower down on the hierarchy. The only two supertypes are pronoun_lexeme and common_noun_lexeme. They only specify for determiner impossibility or optionality, respectively. Their are now types for singular male nouns and singular female nouns that only inherit from common noun, and do not inherit their pernum and gender from elsewhere. Pronouns also put gender and pernum information on their individual lexical entries and do not inherit those features from elsewhere. 

A new class of irregular verbs was created, also to handle "dila." 

Transitive verbs are now specified as taking nominative subjects and either accusative or dative objects. 

Object dropping has been removed from the grammar, because having it there was a mistake to begin with. Objects cannot be dropped in Marathi. 

The project for the weekend will be to make the verb lexical rules more efficient, because were running into overgeneration problems. Verbs that have not been inflected for gender are incorrectly being judged as correct. This is due to their being different position classes for inflecting gender for each case, and, because of this, none of those can obligatorily occur without clashing. All of the rules for gender will be subsumed into one position class.
