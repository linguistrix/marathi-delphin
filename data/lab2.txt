As indicated in the lab2 webpage, we have focussed on the following phenomena in our testsuite:

1. Word Order

Canonical Marathi word order is SOV, with permutations in the word order allowed for specific emphasis, focus or contrast. A typical example of the word order would be (note that that Orthography line right now says dummy orth since we hadn't sorted out the issue with the make_item script yet. It will be deleted later.

dummy orth
polis tsoraalaa maar-t-o
polis tsor-aalaa maar-t-o
policeman thief-ACC beat-PRES-3.S.M
The policeman beats the thief

The grammar book does not present generic negative examples of changed word order. It addresses word order issues only in the placement of additional modifiers and such where the placement changes the meaning or where only one particular configuration is grammatical. In our version of the test-suite right now, we have chosen to explicitly enter other permutations of the SOV order as UNgrammatical. Due to lack of specific examples from the book, I have used my native judgment for this, on the basis that while these permutations do not sound technically wrong, they are extremely unnatural in the absence of specific context or in the absence of a specific writing style (such as poetry, where they are used quite readily).

beat-PRES-3.S.M policeman thief-ACC 
The policeman beats the thief

In NPs, the determiner comes before the Nominal form. Here are a couple of examples that demonstrate this:

That thief slepts

In order to do this on the starter grammar, we chose SOV word order and didn't allow for any flexibility. We plan to revisit this if we get sufficient evidence that word-order is relatively more free.

2. Pronouns

Marathi has a three-way gender system (M/F/N), three-way person system (1/2/3) and a two-way number system (S/P). Likewise, there are 6 corresponding pronouns, though a couple of them are identical in form. In addition, there is a clusivity distinction in the 1st person plural. The pronouns are marked for gender in the 3rd person.

1st person: mii (S), aamhii (P, excl), aapann (P, incl)
2nd person: tu (S), tumhii (P/honorific), aapann (P/honorific)
3rd person (distant): to (M, S), te (M, P), tii (F, S), tyaa (F, P), te (N, S), tii (N, P)
3rd person (proximal): haa (M, S), he (M, P), hii (F, S), hyaa (F, P), he (N, S), hii (N, P)

Several examples have been added to the test suite to illustrate this.

they(fem) slept

The complete list of examples is present in the test-suite file, examples #13 to #43.

We haven't added pronouns to the lexicon yet, because we were not sure how best to represent the entire hierarchy (Case, number, gender, clusivity, proximity), and whether there should be types and sub-types, or just individual lexical entries.

Pronouns do not have determiners, and so this has been disallowed in the starter grammar.

3. Case 

Marathi has 8 cases (which correspond quite exactly to the 8 cases in Sanskrit). Case markers are all bound suffixes which are attached to the end of the NP and they all have distinct case-endings. These attach directly to the nouns, and can be considered affixes.

The 8 cases are:

Nominative: \phi
Accusative: -laa
Instrumental: -ne
Dative: -laa
Ablative: -huun
Genitive: -tsaa
Locative: -t
Vocative: -aa

There is an added complication with case, and that is that the determiner for the noun changes depending on the case of the noun. For instance, 'that thief' is "to tsor" but "that thief's" is "tya tsoraacaa". This hasn't been addressed yet.

The full range of examples are present in the testsuite file.

In order to achieve this, we have fed all the cases to the starter grammar. However, since we haven't done agreement yet, LKB doesn't actually select the case.

Our test suite, however, does have ungrammatical examples for case, as needed.

Another complication with Marathi is the fact that it exhibits split ergativity, with the third person subject of a transitive verb in the perfective aspect being marked with the postposition -ne. 

4. The Whole NP

Determiners are optional for common nouns, so this has been reflected in the grammar, which has examples with both bare NPs and full NPs. Pronouns don't take determiners, so this has been disallowed in the starter grammar, as indicated in the pronoun section.


Overall performance:

As indicated in our posts on GoPost, we are having issues getting tsdb++ to correctly parse everything. When we see Browse | Results, we see 14 sentences being parsed, while Analysis | Coverage and Overgeneration seem to suggest that all sentences are negative sentences. 

As per Browse | Results, 14 sentences are parsed. Please note that since we have not inserted pronouns into the lexicon yet (as explained above), the pronoun examples will not be parsed.

As per the Overgeneration window, there 1.21 distinct analyses, 14 total results, and 23.3% overall coverage. It should be noted here that our test suite currently contains significantly more ungrammatical sentences than grammatical ones in order to illustrate the myriad case and word order restrictions. 

Currently, since no specific agreement requirements have been fed into the grammar, sentences where the agreement is off often end up being parsed as grammatical. 

A look at Browse | Results reveals that while several correct sentences are correctly parsed, there are occasional ungrammatical sentences that are being parsed completely, due to the fact that the case that the correct case that the nouns should possess for a given verb is not encoded in the grammar yet. For instance, a sentence like "*polisaalaa tsoraalaa maarto" (The police beats the thief), where both police and thief are in ACC is parsed by the grammar, but which it eventually shouldn't. In some other cases, a permutation of word order is being parsed correctly for the same reason. For instance "*polisaalaa tsoraalaa maarto" (The police-ACC beats the thief-ACC) is getting parsed while it shouldn't.
	
A problem we faced was that since we chose the Split ergativity setting for our language, when we add verbs in the lexicon, we don't get the option to demand NOM and ACC cases on the nouns. We need to sort this out.

Additionally, since some examples of case, such as the locative, are not parsed currently since the resulting phrase behaves like a modifier. eg. He sleeps in India (to bhaarataat zhopto). Since sleep is intransitive, a sentence like this would not parse currently until we make allowances for modifiers or adverbs or the like.
